## About

The repository is a try to break down the original minified source code of the ROTATE game to see how it's built.

### Project status

So far, all of the primary game entities got renamed to their human-readable names ([reference](https://github.com/satelllte/ROTATE/pull/9)). 

At this point, the main logic flow is readable to some extent. While it still might be quite hard to do so, it has a potential to be improved further by renaming more entities and simplifying more implementations. Additionally, the codebase can be a good start for a fresh remake, which could potentially bring some additional features to the ecosystem more easily (e.g., touch controls support).
